## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 60%, 50%) / RGB hex #3399FF – A vibrant blue, embodying trust and technology, without leaning into overused cliches. It's also vibrant enough to stand out in a dark UI.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 20%) / RGB hex #333940 – A dark, muted blue that provides a professional, serious backdrop, and strong contrast with the primary color.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 70%, 40%) / RGB hex #20B2AA – A bright cyan that is useful for highlights and calls to action (CTAs), contrasting clearly with both the background and primary colors.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Use simple, clean icons that align with a modern, tech-focused aesthetic.
- Responsive layout with clear sections for the trading chart, user dashboard, and admin controls.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience.
